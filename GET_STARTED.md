# PyMTDEvaluator 2.0

PyMTDEvaluator is a tool for time-based Moving Target Defense (MTD) evaluation. The 2.0 version updates the previous one by providing support for Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods and also a improved graphical user interface. The manual below will guide you after [PyMTDEvaluator installation.](https://github.com/matheustor4/PyMTDEvaluator2/blob/main/README.md#installation) 

# Interface selection

PyMTDEvaluator features three interface options. The users can select their preferred ones at tool startup. 

They are Classical, Modern, and Upload XML file.

## Classical interface

The classical interface resembles the previous version of PyMTDEvaluator. It is devoted to the users of the previous versions that intend to continue to use the tool in a familiar interface.

## Modern interface

The modern interface features the option of save/load the parameters in a XML file. Besides that, the interface also presents tooltips for each of the fields. Compared to the previous interface, it has improved aesthetics and user experience (i.e., experiment parameters only appear if the experiment function is selected).

## Upload XML interface

Consists of a simple system dialog to feed the tool directly (i.e., without need to interact with the classical or modern interface) with a previously saved XML file. It is particularly useful in the combination of previous scenarios.
